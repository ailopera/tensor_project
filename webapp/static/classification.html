				<p>I Was Fired for Making Fun of Trump</p>

				<p>
					After 25 years as the editorial cartoonist for The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, I was fired on Thursday. I blame Donald Trump.Well,
					sort of.I should’ve seen it coming. When I had lunch with my new boss a few months ago, he informed me that the paper’s
					publisher believed that the editorial cartoonist was akin to an editorial writer, and that his views should reflect
					the philosophy of the newspaper.That was a new one to me.I was trained in a tradition in which editorial cartoonists
					are the live wires of a publication — as one former colleague put it, the constant irritant. Our job is to provoke readers
					in a way words alone can’t. Cartoonists are not illustrators for a publisher’s politics. When I was hired in 1993, The
					Post-Gazette was the liberal newspaper in town, but it always prided itself on being a forum for a lot of divergent
					ideas. The change in the paper did not happen overnight. From what I remember, it started in 2010, with the endorsement
					of the Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor, which shocked a majority of our readership. The next big moment
					happened in late 2015, when my longtime boss, the editorial page editor, took a buyout after the publisher indicated
					that the paper might endorse Mr. Trump. Then, early this year, we published openly racist editorials. Things really changed
					for me in March, when management decided that my cartoons about the president were too angry and said I was “obsessed
					with Trump.” This about a president who has declared the free press one of the greatest threats to our country. Not every
					idea I have works. Every year, a few of my cartoons get killed. But suddenly, in a three-month period, 19 cartoons or
					proposals were rejected.
